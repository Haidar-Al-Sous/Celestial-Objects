# Three.js Journey

# Celestial Simulation Project

## Overview

This project simulates the interactions and movements of celestial bodies based on physical laws. Users can add and modify celestial objects with specific properties and observe their behaviors.

## Basic Features

- **Gravitational Interaction**: Analyze mutual influences according to the law of universal gravitation.
- **Newtonian Motion**: Study movements using Newton's laws of motion.
- **Custom Celestial Bodies**: Users can add bodies with properties such as:
  - Name
  - Initial position
  - Initial velocity
  - Mass
  - Rotation speed
  - Diameter

## Advanced Features

- **Collision Analysis**: Study collisions between celestial bodies.
- **Relativity Effects**: Incorporate effects from relativity theory.
- **Time and Distance Scaling**: Visualize results with time and distance scaling, allowing acceleration and deceleration of time.
- **Property Modification**: Modify and delete properties during execution.
- **Rotational Dynamics**: Study body rotation and changes due to collisions.

## User Interface

- **Interactive UI**: An interactive interface for displaying data and events, supporting mouse and keyboard interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing simulation logic.
- **CSS**: For styling the interface.
